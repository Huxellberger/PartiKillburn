# What Is This?

This is a simple particle simulator I built for my university course. My main focus was on making something extensible that could be applied to a lot of particle-filled fun times.

If you're doing the module yourself **don't copy my solution!** My style was very over designed (and my attire, I wore a christmas hat to the marking session) so will be immediately obvious to them. Also copying is just plain rude. Feel free to draw inspiration from the concepts (test driven development, clear decoupling of rendering/physics)
